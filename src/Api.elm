{-| A module that provides interactions with the outside world, and in
particular with whatever backend powers the web application.


# Endpoints

It's easy to compose endpoints from the root authenticated endpoint, and not
possible to move outside of the base domain. Enforcing authentication means that
user-composable endpoints logically require a credentials instance, and that
can therefore enforces better defined application state.

@docs Endpoint, authenticated, withCredentials, withPath


# Authentication

It's common to mess things up when performing authentication, and in particular,
it's **very easy** to start doing stupid things inadvertedly (for instance by
logging the authentication credentials or posting them everywhere).

To avoid these problems, access to the value of the authentication tokens is
managed only in this module, and it is not possible to extract the value of the
token and expose it to the outside world !

@docs Credentials, username, moderatorId
@docs login, register, AuthError


# Persistence

If you want to retrieve the credentials on application start, you can do so using the application
function. It will automatically interact with the program flags and retrieve the eventual
credentials.

## Credentials management

@docs storeCredentials, storeCredentialsClear


# Requests

To perform some requests, you must use one of the different methods that are
offered in this API.

-- ENDPOINTS


{-| An opaque type representing the endpoints that will be available throughout
the application. The general idea is that an endpoint will necessarily point to
one of the API endpoints that are defined for the app, and that if you obtain
an instance of endpoint, you're guaranteed to point to a location where it's
safe to send your data.

This guarantees that you can't send any credentials to an unexpected endpoint,
and leak the credentials contents by mistake.

-}
type Endpoint
    = NonAuthenticated String
    | Authenticated Credentials String


{-| Returns a root endpoint that is authenticated. By default, all of the
endpoints that can be composed outside of the Api module are authenticated, and
the only unauthenticated endpoint is the login.

This measure ensures that it's not possible to make requests that would be
authenticated without possessing a credentials instance.
